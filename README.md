# Skin Disease Identification Using Image Analysis

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify different skin diseases from images.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains images of skin diseases such as Acne, Eczema, Psoriasis, etc.

## Model
- A CNN model built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Achieves accuracy on test data and saves the trained model.

## Usage
- Train the model by running `skin_disease_classifier.ipynb`.
- Predict skin disease from images using the saved model.
